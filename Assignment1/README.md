The attached source code only contains one python script.
Pre-requisites:
1. Python 3
2. Any python IDE (we used Spider and Jupyter notebooks using Anaconda)

Please note that this source code does not require any dependencies or environment variables to be set.

The code structure is as follows:

1. Importing libraries 
2. User defined functions
3. Data Preparation and Pre-processing
4. Vectorization
5. Cross Validation
6. Error Analysis

Steps to execute the script:
1. Install Python 3 (https://www.python.org/download/releases/3.0/) or use homebrew if you are a mac user
2. Ensure Python 3 installed properly using the following command 
3. install - python
4. To test if Python is successfully installed, type python on terminal/console. 
   "You should see the output as below:
    Python 3.7.2 (default, Dec 29 2018, 00:00:04) 
    [Clang 4.0.1 (tags/RELEASE_401/final)] :: Anaconda, Inc. on darwin
    Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
    >>>" 
6. Download the "assignment1".py file to your local machine
7. Open command prompt (Windows) or terminal (macintosh)
8. Enter the command - "python <path_of_the_downloaded py file>"
9. For the best results and proper vizualization of charts, we recommend using Spider or Jupyter notebook.
   Download the program and open it with Jupyter notebook and run the cell.  

Deliverables:
1. Project Report
2. Source Code along with the ReadMe File.
3. Results in HTML format
4. Presentation
