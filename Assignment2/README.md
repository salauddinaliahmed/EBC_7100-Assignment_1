The attached source code only contains 3 python scripts. 
1. assign2Core.py 
2. featuresPY.py
3. dataPreProcess.py

Python 3
Any python IDE (we used Spider and Jupyter notebooks using Anaconda)
Please note that this source code does not require any dependencies or environment variables to be set.

The code structure is as follows:

Importing files featuresPY.py and dataPreProcess.py as files in the main python script (assign2Core.py)
User defined functions
Data Preparation and Pre-processing
Feature Engineering - Vectorization 
Evaluation
Error Analysis - Collocations, linkage method change


Steps to execute the script:

Install Python 3 (https://www.python.org/download/releases/3.0/) or use homebrew if you are a mac user
Ensure Python 3 installed properly using the following command
install - python
To test if Python is successfully installed, type python on terminal/console. "You should see the output as below: Python 3.7.2 (default, Dec 29 2018, 00:00:04) [Clang 4.0.1 (tags/RELEASE_401/final)] :: Anaconda, Inc. on darwin Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
"

Download the "Assignment2".py file to your local machine
Open command prompt (Windows) or terminal (macintosh)
Navigate to the downloaded Assignment2 folder through the terminal/command prompt
Enter the command - "python assign2Core.py"
For the best results and proper vizualization of charts, we recommend using Spider or Spyder IDE. Download the program and open the 3 files in spider and run the assign2Core.py.
